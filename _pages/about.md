<strong>Research Interests:</strong> Decision-Making, Controls, Machine/Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Agent Systems, Game Theory<br />
<div style="text-align: justify">My research focuses on developing robust-resilient-adaptive reinforcement learning systems that are generic, provide performance guarantees, and can generalize-reason-improve in complex and unknown task environments. I apply tools from optimization theory, control theory, reinforcement learning, game theory, and graph theory, aiming to provide a comprehensive foundational theory, algorithms, and implementations, to design such systems with some degree of assurance of meeting specifications.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify"><strong>Brief Bio</strong>: I am a Technical Staff with the Control & Autonomous Systems Engineering Group at <a href='https://www.ll.mit.edu'>MIT Lincoln Laboratory</a>. Before joining the Laboratory, I was a Postdoctoral Associate within the <a href='https://isr.umd.edu'>Institute for Systems Research (ISR)</a> at the <a href='https://www.umd.edu'> University of Maryland, College Park</a>. I received my Ph.D. as a <a href='https://eng.umd.edu/clark-doctoral-fellows'>Clark Doctoral Fellow</a> with the <a href='https://eng.umd.edu/clark-doctoral-fellows'>Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at the University of Maryland, College Park. My doctoral work, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.johnbaras.com'>John S. Baras</a>, focused on robust and risk-sensitive reinforcement learning.<!-- During my Ph.D., I was a research intern at <a href='https://www.parc.com'>Palo Alto Research Center (PARC- A Xerox Company</a>) in Palo Alto, California, and a visiting student researcher with <a href='https://www.arl.army.mil'>the US Army Research Lab (ARL)</a> in Adelphi, Maryland. I was also a visiting graduate student with <a href='https://people.kth.se/~kallej/'>Karl Johansson</a> at <a href='https://www.kth.se'>KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden</a>.--> I obtained an M.Sc. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, in Electrical Engineering and a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science) from <a href='https://drexel.edu'>Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>.</div>
