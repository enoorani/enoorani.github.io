I am a Ph.D. candidate with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering and the Institute for Systems Research (ISR) at the University of Maryland, College Park, under the supervision of <a href='https://www.johnbaras.com'>John S. Baras</a>. I interned with <a href='https://www.parc.com'>Palo Alto Research Center (PARC- A Xerox Company</a>) from May 2021 to December 2022. Before PARC, I was a visiting student researcher with <a href='https://www.arl.army.mil'>the US Army Research Lab (ARL)</a> in Adelphi, Maryland. I spent the summer of 2022 as a visiting graduate student with <a href='https://people.kth.se/~kallej/'>Karl Johansson</a>) at <a href='https://www.kth.se'>KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden</a>). I obtained a M.Sc. degree from the University of Maryland, College Park, in Electrical Engineering and a B.Sc. degree in Electrical Engineering (with a minor in Computer Science) from <a href='https://drexel.edu'>Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</a>.

My research focuses on developing robust-resilient-adaptive Reinforcement Learning systems that are generic, provide performance guarantees, and can generalize-reason-improve in complex and unknown task environments. I apply tools from Optimization Theory, Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, and Graph Theory, aiming to provide a comprehensive foundational theory, algorithms, and implementations, to design such systems with some degree of assurance of meeting specifications.
