My research focuses on developing robust-resilient-adaptive Reinforcement Learning systems that are generic, provide performance guarantees, and can generalize-reason-improve in complex and unknown task environments. I apply tools form Optimization Theory, Control Theory, Reinforcement Learning, Game Theory, and Graph Theory, aiming to provide a comprehensive foundational theory, algorithms and implementations, in order to design such systems with some degree of assurance of meeting specifications.
